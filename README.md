Work on the cooling algorithms is not completed.
- **Heating calculations** give satisfactorily verifiable results nearly 100% of the time.
- **Regenerative cooling** gives satisfactorily verifiable results about 80% of the time.
- **Film cooling** gives satisfactorily verifiable results about ??% of the time unless you really know what you are doing.
